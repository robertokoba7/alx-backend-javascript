# ES6 Basics

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX SE programme** and **Holberton School**. It aims to learn about ES6 and its new features. By the end of the project, am expected to be proficient in differentiating constants from variables, comprehending block-scoped variables, arrow functions and their default parameters, rest and spread function parameters, string templating, object creation, and their properties in ES6, as well as utilizing iterators and for-of loops.

## Technologies
* Tested using the `Jest Testing Framework`
* Analyzed using the linter ESLint along with specific rules that we’ll provide.

## Files
**Files**           |**Description**
--------------------|--------------------
`0-constants.js`  | Modify: function `taskFirst` to instantiate variables using `const` & function `taskNext` to instantiate variables using `let`
`1-block-scoped.js` | modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.
`2-arrow.js` | Rewrite the given standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function `add`
`3-default-parameter.js` | Condense the internals of the given function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.
`4-rest-parameter.js` | Rest parameter syntax for functions
`5-spread-operator.js` | Use spread syntax to concatenate 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying the function given
`6-string-interpolation.js` | Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so as to substitute the variables defined.
`7-getBudgetObject.js` | Object property value shorthand syntax
`8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js` | Rewrite the `getBudgetForCurrentYear` function to use ES6 computed property names on the `budget` object.
`9-getFullBudget.js` | Rewrite `getFullBudgetObject` to use ES6 method properties in the `fullBudget` object
`10-loops.js` | Rewrite the function `appendToEachArrayValue` to use ES6’s for...of operator. And don’t forget that `var` is not ES6-friendly.
`11-createEmployeesObject.js` | function named `createEmployeesObject` that will receive two arguments: `departmentName` (String) & `employees` (Array of Strings).
`12-createReportObject.js` | function named `createReportObject` whose parameter, `employeesList`, is the return value of the previous function `createEmployeesObject`.
`100-createIteratorObject.js` | Function named `createIteratorObject`, that will take into argument a report Object created with the previous function `createReportObject`
`101-iterateThroughObject.js` | function named `iterateThroughObject`. The function’s parameter `reportWithIterator` is the return value from `createIteratorObject`.
